- provide example rpc
- at least include extensions in Descriptor
- test code:
  - service method lookups
  - out-of-order fields in messages (ie if the number isn't ascending)
  - gaps in numbers: check that the number of ranges is correct

- Documentations:
  - __INIT macro
  - service __init function
  - get rid of docs for create-service; update generally
  - check over documentation again

- support Group (whatever it is)
- almost no code generator options are obeyed
- ISSUE: strings may not contain NULs
- generate Init functions / handle default values
- proper support for extensions (not sure i get what's needed)

- get rid of kThick/ThinSeparator if we decide not to use them
- stop using qsort in the code generator:  find some c++ish way to do it
